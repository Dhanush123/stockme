Anywhere during transmission, the API call could fail. The API knows this, so it periodically returns a token you can use when you retry the request.\n\nWhen you get a result that has that token, that's kind of like a \"checkpoint\". It means, release all the results we've received up until now, because we know we'll be able to pick up from here when we go to retry the request.\n\n## API\n\n### checkpointStream(config)\n\n- Returns `TransformStream` (via [`through2`](http://gitnpm.com/through2))\n\n### checkpointStream.obj(config)\n\n- Returns `TransformStream` (via [`through2`](http://gitnpm.com/through2))\n\n#### config\n\n- **Required**\n- Type: `Object` or `Function`\n\nA configuration object. If a function is provided, it is treated as `config.isCheckpointFn`.\n\n##### config.isCheckpointFn\n\n- **Required**\n- Type: `Function`\n\nThis function will receive each data event that is emitted from the source stream. Return a boolean to indicate if this is a checkpoint or not. If it is a checkpoint, this event, and any previously queued events before it will be passed through to the next stream in your pipeline. If it is not a checkpoint, this event will be queued until you return `true` in a future data event.\n\n##### config.maxQueued\n\n- *Optional*\n- Type: `Number`\n- Default: `10`\n\nConfigure how many results will be queued before they are released, regardless of if a checkpoint has been reached.\n\n##### config.objectMode\n\n- *Optional*\n- Type: `Boolean`\n- Default: `false`\n\nEnable `objectMode` when dealing with streams in object mode.\n",
